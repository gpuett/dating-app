## A dating app
####  By Bobby Martin, Garnett Puett, Ami Cooper, Semhar Kidane and Matt Nardoni

### Description
A dating app with a swiping and matching feature built in Angular and a custom database on heroku.

### User stories
* A user should be able to sort potential matches by selecting their desired partner's orientation (man seeking women)
* A user should be able to like or reject other users.
* A 'liked' user should be appended to a list which will populate another page.

### Setup and installation instructions
Server Repository: https://github.com/gpuett/dating-app-server
API: https://dating-app-server.herokuapp.com/users

  1. If Angular is not installed, run `npm install -g @angular/cli@1.6.5`
  2. Navigate to the project root directory and run `npm install`
  3. To view site on a live development server, run the command `ng serve --open`. This will open the site on a local server and will update whenever changes to the project files are saved.
